# VeloTracker
This is a tracking system that uses iPhones to track trikes in the Australian Pedal Prix races.

Currently in devlopment

VeloTracker is the app that is on the iphone in the trike, this allows riders to see data metrics such as current speed, amount of laps (Stints), total distance and average laptime.

To view this data outside of the trike in real time, VeloCore is used on a macbook (soon going to other platforms) in the respected team's pitstop. This allows staff of the team to view rider's metrics, see real time location and message the rider. This is done by VeloTracker communicating to VeloCore via Google Firebase.
